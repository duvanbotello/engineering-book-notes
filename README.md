# Dev Notes

A bilingual (Spanish-first) knowledge base for personal notes on software engineering books.

## Why this repository exists

This repository exists to turn book notes into a practical engineering handbook:

- Capture personal reflections, lessons, and actionable ideas.
- Keep ideas easy to find by book, chapter, and concept.
- Share notes publicly in a clean English translation.
- Build a long-term reference that remains useful over time.

## Language policy

- Spanish is the source of truth.
- English is a clean, professional translation.
- Each file uses only one language.

## Books index

- `software-engineering-at-google`
  - English: [`books/software-engineering-at-google/README.md`](books/software-engineering-at-google/README.md)
  - Spanish: [`books/software-engineering-at-google/README.es.md`](books/software-engineering-at-google/README.es.md)

## How notes are organized

Notes are organized in three levels:

1. Repository index (`README.md`, `README.es.md`)
2. Book index (`books/<book-name>/README*.md`)
3. Chapter notes (`books/<book-name>/chapters/*.md`)

Each chapter includes top and bottom navigation, language switching, and cross-links.
