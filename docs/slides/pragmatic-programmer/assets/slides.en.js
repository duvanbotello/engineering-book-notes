      "In non-orthogonal systems, one local decision impacts multiple parts.",
      "If external interfaces stay stable, a component can evolve with less risk.",

    narrative:
      "Pragmatic paranoia means validating assumptions, defining clear contracts, and stopping execution when impossible states appear, because a corrupted system causes more damage than a fast-failing system.",

      "Do not trust blindly, even your own technical judgment can fail.",
      "Assertive programming: when you think 'this should never happen,' add explicit validation.",
